# Tools for distributed model inference
Model serving is making predictions using a ML model.
Some of the popular tools for that include:
- vLLM
- FasterTransformer
# Tools for both, distributed inference and training
- [[_DeepSpeed]]
# Tools for distributed model training
- Horovod (can be run on k8s)
- PyTorch DDP
- Kubeflow Training Operator – it makes it simpler to run for example Horovod or PyTorch DDP on Kubernetes
