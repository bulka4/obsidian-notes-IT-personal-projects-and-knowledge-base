# Basics of probability
Probability space is the backbone of the entire probability theory. It defines what are events and probabilities of those events.
1. [[Probability space (events, probability measure)]]
# Probabilities of events
1. [[Events operations]] - Probabilities of sum of events, their difference, intersection etc.
2. [[Conditional probability]] - Probability of an event given some condition - $P(A \mid B)$ 
3. [[Joint probability]] - Probability of multiple events happening together - $P(A_1 \wedge A_2 \wedge \ldots)$ 
4. [[Joint conditional probability]] - Probability of multiple events happening together given some condition - $P(A_1 \wedge A_2 \wedge \ldots \mid B)$ 
5. [[Events independency]] - $P(A_1 \wedge A_2 \wedge \ldots) = P(A_1) \cdot P(A_2) \cdot \ldots$ 
# Random variables
When we talk about events, we usually mean events generated by random variables.

3. [[Event generated by a random variable]] - How random variables creates events: $P(A) = P(X \in A)$ 
4. [[Multivariate random variable]] - Random variables with a multi-dimensional output $X(\omega) = (X_1(\omega), \ldots, X_n(\omega))$

## Common probability distributions
1. [[Normal (Gaussian) distribution]]
2. [[Laplace distribution]]

5. [[Independency of random variables]]
6. [[Probability distribution function for independent random variables]]
# Marginalization
When we know a probability distribution of a set of variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$, then we can calculate a probability distribution of a subset of those variables $\large X_{i_1}, \ldots, X_{i_n}$, for chosen set of indexes $I = \{i_1, \ldots, i_n\}$
