# Introduction
Accuracy tells us in how many percent of cases model was correct.

It is important metric to us if we want to have an overall correctness, for a model to be always correct, in any case.

It is calculated using values from a Confusion Matrix ([[Confusion matrix|link]]):
$$
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{\text{Total number of all the samples}}
$$
