# Introduction
It is a process which monitors DAG directory for changes (it look at files and detects new or modified DAGs), determines which tasks need to be ran and places them in queue for execution.

For example about how it works, refer to here [[Airflow - Example workflow – Scheduler, Executor and Worker]].
