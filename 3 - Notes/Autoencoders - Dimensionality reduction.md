# Introduction
Autoencoders ([[Autoencoders|link]]) can be used to reduce number of dimensions for the feature vector $x$ ([[Dimensionality reduction|link]]).

The latent vector $y$ generated by the encoder might be interpreted as a new set of features, with a reduced size compared to the original features $x$.
