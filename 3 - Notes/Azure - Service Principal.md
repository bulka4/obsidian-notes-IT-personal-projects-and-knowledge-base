# Introduction
We can use a Service Principal for authentication. We can assign to a Service Principal a role and scope for specific resources.

Then we can use this Service Principal’s credentials in our applications to authenticate when using those resources.

For example we might have a Service Principal with a scope for ACR allowing for pushing Docker images there.

Service Principal has assigned a client (app) ID and password.
