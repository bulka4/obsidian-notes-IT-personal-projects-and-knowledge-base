# Formal definition
Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be sets ([[Set|link]]). Their Cartesian product is the set of all ordered tuples formed by taking one element from each set:
$$
X_1 \times \ldots \times X_n = \{(x_1, \ldots, x_n): x_i \in X_i, \forall i = 1, \ldots, n\}
$$
In short we can write it using the product sign ([[Mathematical general notations and shorthands|link]]):
$$
X_1 \times \ldots \times X_n = \prod_{i=1}^n X_i
$$
