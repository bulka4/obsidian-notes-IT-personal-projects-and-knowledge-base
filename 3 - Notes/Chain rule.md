# Introduction
Chain rule allows to calculate a derivative of a composed function:
$$
f = f^{(k)} \circ \dots \circ f^{(1)}
$$
There are two documents explaining it:
- [[Jacobian chain rule]] - The Jacobian chain rule, which is the general rule describing how to calculate derivative of $f$ 
- [[Gradient chain rule]] - Gradient chain rule which is a special case of the Jacobian rule, when the final function $f^{(k)}$ is a scalar one.
