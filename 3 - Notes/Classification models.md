# Introduction
Classification is a task of assigning a category to an object. We are predicting a value of a categorical variable ([[Types of variables used for creating ML models|link]]), which has a finite amount of possible values.
# Types of classification
There are two types of classification:
- Binary classification - There are only two possible classes
- Multi-class classification - There are more than two possible classes
# Model's output
Usually, in case of classification, for a given data sample $x_i$, model's output $f_\theta(x_i)$ ([[What is a Machine Learning model|link]]) is a probability distribution over classes. More information about that can be found here - [[Machine Learning model output as probabilities for classes|link]].
# Models for classification
For classification we can use such models as:
- AdaBoost - [[AdaBoost|link]]
- Decision Tree - [[Decision Tree|link]]
- Random Forest - [[Random Forest|link]]
- KNN - [[K nearest neighbors (KNN)|link]]
- Logistic Regression - [[Logistic Regression|link]]
- Naive bayes - [[Naive Bayes|link]]
- Neural Network - [[Neural Network|link]]
