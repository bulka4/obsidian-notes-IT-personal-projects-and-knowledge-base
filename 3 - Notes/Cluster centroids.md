# Introduction
In clustering methods, cluster centroid refers to the center of a cluster, a point which is in the middle of all the points.

If we have a cluster C containing n points:
$$
C = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\}, x_i \in \mathbb{R}^d
$$
Then centroid $\mu$ is the mean of all the cluster's points:
$$
\mu = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i
$$
