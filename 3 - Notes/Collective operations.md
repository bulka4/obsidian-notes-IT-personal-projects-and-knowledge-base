# Introduction
Collective operations are used in distributed computing ([[__Distributed_computing|link]]), where multiple processes on multiple computers perform part of calculations and generates partial results. 

Collective operations can gather those partial results, perform on them additional operations or send those results from one computer to another.

The main examples of collective operations include:
- All-Reduce - [[Collective operations - All-Reduce]]
- All-Gather - [[Collective operations - All-Gather]]
- Reduce-Scatter - [[Collective operations - Reduce-Scatter]]
- Broadcast - [[Collective operations - Broadcast]]
