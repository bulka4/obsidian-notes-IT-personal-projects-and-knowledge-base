# Introduction
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space ([[Probability space (events, probability measure)|link]]). 

A conditional probability distribution of a random variable ([[Random variable|link]]) $Y$ (can be a multivariate ([[Multivariate random variable|link]]) and discrete, continuous or mixed ([[Types of random variables|link]])):
$$
Y: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{Y}})
$$
is a measure ([[Measure|link]]):
$$
P_{Y \mid X}(\cdot \mid x): A \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{Y}} \rightarrow P_{Y \mid X}(A \mid x) \in [0, 1]
$$
This measure is used to calculate probabilities of events generated by the random variable ([[Event generated by a random variable|link]]) this way:
$$
P(Y \in A \mid X = x) = P_{Y \mid X}(A \mid x)
$$
Value $x$ is fixed and it represents the condition $X = x$. For different values of $x$ we have different probability distributions.
# Formal definition
Let's assume, that:
- $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ - Probability space
- We have random variables (can be a multivariate and discrete, continuous or mixed):
	- $X: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}})$
	- $Y: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{Y}})$
- $P_{X, Y}$ - Joint probability distribution ([[Probability distribution|link]]) of $X, Y$ 
- $P_X$ - Marginal probability distribution of $X$

**Conditional probability distribution** of $Y$ given $X$ is a measure:
$$
P_{Y \mid X}: \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{Y}} \times \mathcal{X} \rightarrow [0, 1]
$$
such that for all measurable sets ([[Measurable set|link]]) $A \subseteq \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{Y}},\ B \subseteq \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}}$:
$$
P_{X, Y}(B \times A) = \int_B P_{Y \mid X} (A \mid x) dP_X(x)
$$
where:

$\int dP_X$ is Lebesgue integral ([[Lebesgue integral|link]]).

For each fixed $x \in \mathcal{X}$, the function 
$$
P_{Y \mid X}(\cdot \mid x): A \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{Y}} \rightarrow P_{Y \mid X}(A \mid x) \in [0, 1]
$$
- Is a **conditional probability measure** on $(\mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{Y}})$
- Is used for calculating probabilities: $P(Y \in A \mid X = x) = P_{Y \mid X}(A \mid x)$ 
- For different values of $x$ we obtain different measures

For each fixed $A \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{Y}}$, the function:
$$
P_{Y \mid X} (A \mid \cdot): x \in \mathcal{X} \rightarrow P_{Y \mid X} (A \mid x) \in [0, 1]
$$
- Is measurable
- This is the function used in the integral
# Naming conventions
The conditional probability distribution $P_{Y \mid X}$ is also called:
- '**Joint conditional probability distribution**' if $Y = (Y_1, \ldots, Y_n)$ is a multivariate variable which consists of all the considered random variables
- '**Marginal conditional probability distribution**' if $Y = (Y_1, \ldots, Y_k)$ is only a subset of all the considered random variables ([[Marginal conditional probability distribution|link]])
# Multivariate random variable
When $Y$ and $X$ are multivariate random variables:
$$
\begin{gathered}
Y = (Y_1, \ldots, Y_n): (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{Y}_1 \times \ldots \times \mathcal{Y}_n,\ \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{Y}_1} \otimes \ldots \otimes \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{Y}_n}) \\

X = (X_1, \ldots, X_m): (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{X}_1 \times \ldots \times \mathcal{X}_m,\ \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}_1} \otimes \ldots \otimes \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}_m})
\end{gathered}
$$
then we usually denote probability distribution as:
$$
\Large
P_{Y_1, \ldots, Y_n \mid X_1, \ldots, X_m}
$$
or in short:
$$
\Large
P_{Y_{1:n} \mid X_{1:m}}
$$
This measure is defined on the product measurable space ([[Product measurable space|link]]) $(\mathcal{Y}_1 \times \ldots \times \mathcal{Y}_n,\ \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{Y}_1} \otimes \ldots \otimes \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}_n})$, but it doesn't have to be a product measure ([[Product measure|link]]).
## Multivariate random variable vs set of random variables
It is worth to highlight, as described here - [[Multivariate random variable vs set or random variables|link]], that considering a single multivariate random variable:
$$
Y = (Y_1, \ldots, Y_n): (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{Y}_1 \times \ldots \times \mathcal{Y}_n,\ \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{Y}_1} \otimes \ldots \otimes \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{Y}_n})
$$
Is equivalent to considering a set of different random variables:
$$
\large
Y_i: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{Y}_i, \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{Y}_i})
$$
Those concepts are equivalent and all the formulas and definitions works the same.

For example, probability distribution $P_{Y \mid X}$ of a single, multivariate random variable $Y = (Y_1, \ldots, Y_n)$ is equivalent to a joint probability distribution of its components $\Large P_{Y_{1:n} \mid X_{1:m}}$.
# Probability distribution function
For a given conditional probability distribution, there might exist a conditional probability distribution function which allows to represent a conditional probability distribution measure using another measure as described here - [[Conditional probability distribution (density, mass) function]].
