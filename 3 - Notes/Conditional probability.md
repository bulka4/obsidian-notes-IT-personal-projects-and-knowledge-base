# Introduction
Let's assume that $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ is a probability space ([[Probability space (events, probability measure)|link]]) and $A, B \in \mathcal{F}$ are events.

Conditional probability is a probability of some event happening given some condition. We write it as $P(A | B)$, where $A$ - event, $B$ - condition.

It is defined as:
$$
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)} {P(B)}
$$
# Relation to events independency
If $A$ is independent on $B$ ([[Events independency|link]]), then 
$$
P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)} {P(A)} = \frac{P(A) \cdot P(B)} {P(B)} = P(B)
$$
