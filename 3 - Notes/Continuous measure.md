# Introduction
A continuous measure ([[Measure|link]]) represents mass that is spread smoothly across the space - it doesn't concentrate on single points. 

So measure of a set ([[Set|link]]) containing a single element is zero. Only sets with multiple elements have assigned non-zero value.

For example, the Lebesgue measure ([[Lebesgue measure|link]]) is continuous, which for $\mathbb{R}$ assigns length to intervals:
$$
\mu([a, b]) = b - a
$$
so for a single point it equals to zero $\mu(\{a\}) = 0$.
# Formal definition
A measure $\mu$ on $(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}})$ is called continuous if it assigns zero measure to all singletons (sets containing a single element):
$$
\forall x \in \mathcal{X}: \mu(\{x\}) = 0
$$
