# Introduction
Countable set ([[Set|link]]) is such a set whose elements can be listed one by one in a sequence (finite or infinite), like natural numbers.
# Formal definition
A set $A$ is countable if there exists a bijection ([[Bijective function|link]]) between $A$ and a subset of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ or the entire set of natural numbers.
# Example
For example, a set of natural numbers is countable.

On the other hand, set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ is uncountable because no matter how we try to list all the real numbers, we will miss some of them.

If we choose two points $a, b$, there will always be another real number between them: $a < c < b$.
