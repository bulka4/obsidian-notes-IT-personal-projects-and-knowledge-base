# Introduction
This document explains the Workflow orchestration with Airflow which is part of the Data and ML platform project. More info about that project can be found here - [[Data and ML platform project]].
# Accessing Airflow webserver
We can access Airflow UI at the `localhost:8080` URL.

We use a `nodePort` type of a Kubernetes service for the webserver to enable accessing this URL from the host.

This service is specified in `helm_charts/airflow/values.yaml` file and we also map the port used in the `nodePort` to the host port in the `kind-config.yaml` file (so we can access this service from our host, not from a kind node container).

In `helm_charts/airflow/values.yaml` we specify the `NodePort` service to be used:
```yaml
webserver:
	service:
		type: NodePort
		ports:
			- port: 80          # service port (used inside the cluster)
			  targetPort: 8080  # container port
			  nodePort: 30080   # node port
```

and we map the `nodePort` to the port on the host in the kind-config file:
```yaml
nodes:
	- role: control-plane
		- containerPort: 30080
		  hostPort: 8080
		  protocol: TCP
```

Then, the traffic will go like this:
- host port (port on the host specified in the `kind-config.yaml`) ->
- container port / node port (port in the kind node container, specified in the `kind-config.yaml` as `containerPort` and in the service as `nodePort`) ->
- target port (port in the container running in the kind cluster, specified in the service)
# Mounting DAGs code into Airflow pods
To make DAGs code available for Airflow, we need to mount a folder from the local host. There are two approaches:
- Mount the `apps` folder to have local files available
- Mount the `git_code` folder and use git-sync to pull code from a repo into that folder.

The `dagsPvc.hostPath` parameter in the `values.yaml` specifies which folder we want to mount.

Depending on what option we choose, we need to also provide a proper `subPath` parameter:
- When `hostPath` = `apps`, then `subPath` = `airflow/dags`
- When `hostPath` = `git_code`, then `subPath` = `apps/airflow/dags`
## Git-sync
We can use git-sync to pull code from a git repo and make it available in pods running Airflow components (scheduler etc).

Git-sync is deployed separately using its own Helm chart (`helm_charts/git_sync`). It will save code on the host in the `git_code` folder which we can then mount into Airflow pods.

More info about it can be found here - [[Data and ML platform project - Making code available in pods]], in the 'git-sync' section.
# Metadata db
We create a PostgreSQL db for Airflow metadata as a separate deployment in the same Helm chart.

We do this so we don't pay for a managed service but for production it is recommended to use a managed service since running a database on Kubernetes is problematic as described here - [[Kubernetes - Running databases]].
# Service account
We create a service account which will be used by Airflow pods for creating new pods with pod operator where tasks will be executed. 

In `values.yaml` we define that this service account will be used by Airflow components (scheduler etc.).
# KubernetesPodOperator
In the Airflow dag, when using the `KubernetesPodOperator` for running a task in a new pod, we need to use `image_pull_policy="IfNotPresent"` argument so we don't try to pull an image for that pod from a remote registry but we use a local image loaded to kind instead.
# dbt with Airflow
Notes about using dbt with Airflow are here - [[Data and ML platform project - dbt with Airflow]].
# Airflow logs
Airflow logs are being saved to Azure Storage Account. This is set up using env vars in `values.yaml` file, like `AIRFLOW__LOGGING__REMOTE_LOGGING`.
# Differences from the prod deployment
This section describes how running Airflow on AKS differs from running it on kind.
## DAGs PV
In prod, as a storage for DAGs PV we use Azure File share.
## Service Account
In prod, Service Account uses a secret for pulling images from ACR.
## Exposing and accessing the Airflow webserver
In prod we use a load balancer service for the webserver so it gets a public IP which we use to access Airflow UI.
