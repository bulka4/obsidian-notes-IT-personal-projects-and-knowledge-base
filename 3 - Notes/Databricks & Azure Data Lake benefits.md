# Introduction
l We can store any type of file - structured and unstructured data, machine learning models

l We have distributed storage and computing - so we never run out of memory or computational power

l Flexibility of programming - in Databricks notebooks we can execute python or scala code which gives us a lot of flexibility when building data pipelines, making calculations on a data and it allows for building machine learning models

l We can store data in a delta table format which provides for example following benefits:
- Fast data querying - that’s because data is stored in a column oriented way
- Time travel - we can check how table looked like before because there is information saved about what changes were made to a table
- Efficient updating, inserting and deleting rows
- Efficient modifying table schema - adding, modifying, deleting columns
