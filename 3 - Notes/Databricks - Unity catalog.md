# Introduction
Unity catalog has a few main purposes:
- Storing tables metadata – enabling using SQL queries on them, similarly to Hive
- Providing access control – Regulates access to data
- Providing data lineage
- Providing three level namespace: catalog.schema.table – Catalogs consinst of schemas and schemas consist of tables.
- Providing metadata management through API – Using Databricks Rest API we can manage catalogs, schemas, permissions.
