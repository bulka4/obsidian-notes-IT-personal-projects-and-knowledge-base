# Introduction
Decision tree ([[Decision Tree|link]]) can be used for a dimensionality reduction ([[Dimensionality reduction|link]]), that is reducing number of features we use for making predictions.

As explained in the document about a decision tree, it calculates a gini impurity for each feature measuring how useful is that feature for making predictions.

We can reduce number of features, by choosing those features, which have the lowest gini impurity value, those are feature higher in the tree structure.
