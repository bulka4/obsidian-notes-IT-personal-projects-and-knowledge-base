Here are the most important aspects of DeepSpeed
- It is a tool for distributed ML model training and inference
- It can make calculations on GPUs
- It uses PyTorch, built on top of PyTorch Distributed
- It performs calculations on a cluster of nodes (a group of servers)
- It can be deployed on Kubernetes
