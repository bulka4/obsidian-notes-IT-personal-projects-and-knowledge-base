# Introduction
Derivative of a function $f: X \rightarrow Y$ is a function providing an information about whether that function is increasing or decreasing at a specific point.

it is denoted as:
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} 
\leftarrow \text{functions}
$$
where $x$ is function's argument and $y$ is an output:
$$
f(x) = y
$$
To denote value of derivative at a specific point, we write:
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x) \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}(x) \leftarrow \text{value of the function for a specific argument } x
$$
# Interpretation
Derivative $\Large \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ tells us about dependency between $f$ and $x$, whether increasing value of $x$ causes an increase or decrease in the value of $f$.

If derivative for a specific point is positive:
$$
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}(x) > 0
$$
that means, that function $f$ is increasing in that point (increasing value of $x$ causes increasing value of $f(x)$).

For negative derivative it is decreasing, and for a zero derivative, it is constant.
