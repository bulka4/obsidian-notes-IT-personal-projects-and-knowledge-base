# Introduction
Direction of a vector $v$ is defined as:
$$
\frac{v}{||v||}
$$
where $||x||$ is a norm ([[Vector norm|link]]) of a vector (its length).

So we can say that each vector has a direction but we often also say in short that a vector is a direction, because each vector defines one direction.
# Example
For example, a vector [1, 0] means:
- Move 1 unit to the right (on the x-axis, the first coordinate)
- Move 0 units up / down (on the y-axis, the second coordinate)

And vector [1,1] would be directed towards top right-hand corner.

So the direction of that vector is right. In general, for a 2-D vector of format [x, y], we have:
- Positive x - Move right
- Negative x - Move left
- Positive y - Move up
- Negative y - Move down
