# Introduction
We can calculate distance between vectors in order to compare how similar they are. This is used for example in clustering where we are finding clusters which centroids are closest to a given point.

To calculate that distance we can use for example Euclidean distance.
# Euclidean distance
Euclidean distance between vectors $X$ and $Y$ is given by the formula:
$$
\sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^{i=n} (x_i - y_i)^2 }
$$
