# Introduction
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space ([[Probability space (events, probability measure)|link]]).

We have defined the following operations on probabilities of events:
- $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)$, where $A^c = \Omega \setminus A$ - complement of $A$  
- $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
