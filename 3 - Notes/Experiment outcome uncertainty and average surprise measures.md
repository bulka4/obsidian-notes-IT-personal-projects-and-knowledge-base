# Introduction
There are measures which allow us to measure uncertainty of an experiment outcome, or equivalently, an average surprise of an experiment outcome.

Below is explained what do we mean by uncertainty and average surprise and also what are other interpretations.
# Explanation
How surprise is measured is explained here - [[Surprise measure]]. In short, surprise is big when we observe an unlikely event (with a small probability of occurring).

Uncertainty of an experiment outcome means how hard it is to predict an outcome. High uncertainty means that it is hard to predict.

Experiment has a high uncertainty, if the highest probabilities are distributed across many different outcomes.

That means, that experiment frequently results in unlikely events, so if we continue conducting an experiment, we will frequently see many different outcomes, where each one has relatively small probability.

Equivalently that means, that experiment has a high average surprise and it frequently results in highly surprising (unlikely) events.

On the other hand, experiment has a low uncertainty, if:
- The highest probabilities are distributed across a small number of different outcomes
- Experiment rarely results in unlikely events 
- Average surprise is low
## Graphical explanation
Events (experiment outcomes) usually can be represented as observing different values of a random variable $X$ ([[Event generated by a random variable|link]]).

If uncertainty (and average surprise) is high, that means that the highest probabilities are distributed across many different outcomes, like in the green graph below.

On the other hand, if uncertainty (and average surprise) is low, that means that the highest probabilities are distributed across a small number of different outcomes, like in the blue graph below.

This graph shows a normal distribution, that is a distribution for a continuous random variable, but similar visualization would explain the same for a discrete random variable (we would just have dots instead of continuous lines).
# Example
For example, let's consider an experiment, where we randomly select a car from a group of cars. Different car brands correspond to different outcomes.

Below is described how a value of an uncertainty measure, and equivalently a value of an average surprise measure, differs in different scenarios.

That is how uncertain and surprised we are in different scenarios.

***Scenario 1 - Two equally distributed brands***
If we have only two brands in the same amounts:
- Brand A - 50%
- Brand B - 50%
then when we select a car, we will see each brand for 50% of time, so an outcome is unpredictable and uncertainty is high.

Also an average surprise is high because we see all the time unlikely events.

***Scenario 2 - Ten different brands, two brands dominate***
If we have two dominating brands and 8 uncommon brands, for example:
- Brand A - 48%
- Brand B - 48%
- Other 8 brands - 4%
then when we select a car, we will still see brand A for around 50% of time and brand B for another 50% (probability mass is still concentrated on those two brands), so an outcome is just as unpredictable as in the scenario 1, uncertainty and surprise are similarly high.

***Scenario 3 - Ten different brands, one brand dominates***
If we have one brand dominating among 10 different brands, for example:
- Brand A - 95%
- Other 9 brands - 5%
then when we select a car, we will still most of the time the brand A, so an outcome is much more predictable then in the previous scenarios so uncertainty and surprise are much lower.
## Describing the example with random variables
The above example can be described using random variables what is also explained here - [[Event generated by a random variable|link]].

We can define such a **random variable** $X$, that different values of $X$ indicates events of selecting different brands, for example:
- $X = 1$ means that brand A was selected
- $X = 2$ means that brand B was selected
- etc.

And group of cars can be seen as a **dataset of observations** ([[Observations - realizations of random variables|link]]) of a random variable $X$.

So that is an example of a discrete random variable ([[Types of random variables|link]]) but we can also talk about uncertainty and surprise for an event in case of continuous random variables like described in the next section.
## Continuous random variables
As described in the previous section, the earlier example is related to discrete random variables and we can also talk about an uncertainty and surprise for an event in case of continuous random variables. 

For example we can have an experiment where we randomly select a person from a group of people, and we want to predict the height of that person.

Low uncertainty and average surprise will mean that when we randomly select a person, they will always have a similar height, let's say that will be a height from the range 175 - 185cm.
# Other interpretations
## Diversity of a dataset
Uncertainty and average surprise measure can be also seen as a measure of a diversity of a dataset.

As explained earlier, the example can be described using random variables and group of cars can be seen as a dataset of observations of a random variable $X$.

In the example, we could see that uncertainty and average surprise is low when one car brand dominates in the group, so we have a distribution of brands in that group like this:
- Brand A - 95%
- Other 9 brands - 5%

That means, that low uncertainty and average surprise is the same as low **diversity of a dataset of observations of a random variable**.
### Diversity of a probability distribution
A dataset can be used as an empirical approximation of the true probability distribution of $X$ ([[Probability distribution|link]]).

If we have for example a dataset consisting of 100 cars with a distribution:
- Brand A - 95
- Other 9 brands - 5

Then empirical, approximated probability distribution of the random variable $X$ is:
- Brand A - 95% (probability of selecting the brand A is 95%, that is $P(X = 1) = 0.95$)
- Other brands - 5%

So we can say, that low uncertainty and average surprise is the same as low **diversity in probability distribution of outcomes**.
# Uncertainty and surprise in context of training models
When training a statistical models, we often want create a modeled probability distribution $q$ which is as similar as possible to the true probability distribution $p$.
## Uncertainty
Uncertainty is a property of an experiment or a random variable, that describes how uncertain we are about what outcome of the experiment or observation of the random variable we will see.

We can talk about two types of uncertainty:
- The true uncertainty of an experiment (or a random variable) described by the true probability distribution $p$
- The uncertainty which we see if we use the modeled distribution $q$ instead of the true one $p$ 
## Surprise
When we say how surprised we are, that is according to a specific probability distribution. 

Distribution $p$ might assign a high probability to an event, while distribution $q$ can assign a low probability to the same event.

So we are surprised according to $q$ but not according to $p$.

Common methods of measuring uncertainty (average surprise) include:
- [[Gini impurity]]
- [[Entropy]]
