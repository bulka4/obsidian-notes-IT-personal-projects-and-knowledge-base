# Introduction
Feature engineering is about creating pipelines which creates datasets with features which models use for making predictions.

We need to make sure that those pipelines are:
- Reproducible
- Optimized computationally (we can use incremental computing)

We need to also take care of feature versioning which is a combination of using data and code versioning.
