# Introduction
In machine learning, we often want to predict a value of a target variable $y$ corresponding to a given feature vector $x$ from the feature space ([[Feature space|link]]).

Let's group feature vectors based on the value of the corresponding target variable.

Below documents show visualizations of different scenarios of how those feature vector groups might looks like in the feature space:
- Sparsely and densely distributed feature vectors - [[Sparsely and densely distributed feature vectors - Visualization|link]]
- Multiple groups of feature vectors - [[Multiple feature vector groups - Visualization|link]]
