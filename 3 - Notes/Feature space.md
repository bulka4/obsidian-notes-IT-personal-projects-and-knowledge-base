# Introduction
As described here - [[Types of numeric inputs for ML models|link]], inputs for ML models can be multidimensional tensors (1-D, 2-D etc.).

As a feature space, we describe a vector space ([[Vector space|link]]) containing feature vectors (1-D tensors) which are an input for a ML model.
# Visualizing feature space
Here we can see how to visualize feature vectors in a feature space in different, common scenarios - [[Feature space visualization]].
