# Introduction
When we create a new branch, we create it from some specific, existing branch (parent branch) and commit.

- New branch contains all the commits done earlier until the commit from which we created a new branch
- When we create new commits in the new branch, they are present only in that new branch, not in the parent branch
- When we merge our branch to the main one, then all the commits made on our new branch become visible from the main one
