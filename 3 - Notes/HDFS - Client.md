# Introduction
Client is a software that users use to talk to HDFS. Clients are for example:
- HDFS CLI tool (the hdfs command)
- HDFS Java API
- Other hadoop tools (Spark, Hive, Pig)
- Third-party tools or GUIs that works with HDFS (Hue, Apache Nifi)

So users talk to a client and client talks to HDFS.
