# Introduction
Let's assume that $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ is a probability space ([[Probability space (events, probability measure)|link]]) and $A_1, \ldots, A_n, B_1, \ldots, B_m \in \mathcal{F}$ are events.

Joint conditional probability is a probability of multiple events happening together given multiple conditions:
$$
P(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i \mid \bigcap_{i=1}^m B_i)
$$
# Independency
How independency works in case of joint conditional probability is described here - [[Events independency]].
