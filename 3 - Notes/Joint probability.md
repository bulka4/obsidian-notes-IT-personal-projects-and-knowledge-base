# Introduction
Let's assume that $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ is a probability space ([[Probability space (events, probability measure)|link]]) and $A_1, \ldots, A_n \in \mathcal{F}$ are events.

Joint probability is a probability of multiple events happening together:
$$
P(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i)
$$
# Events independency
If $A_i$ are independent ([[Events independency|link]]), then:
$$
P(\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i) = \prod_{i=1}^n P(A_i)
$$
