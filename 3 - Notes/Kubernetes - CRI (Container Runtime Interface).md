# Introduction
Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface) is a tool that allows Kubernetes to talk to different container runtimes (like containerd, Docker, or CRI-O). It defines how pods are started, stopped, and managed on nodes.

It standardizes operations like:
- Pulling images
- Creating containers
- Setting up namespaces, cgroups
- Mounting volumes
- Networking setup
