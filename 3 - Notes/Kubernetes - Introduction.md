# Introduction

In short Kubernetes allows us to manage multiple applications running across multi node cluster.

It helps with allocating computer resources (CPU, RAM etc.) to applications. In that aspect, it is like a kernel but for a cluster consisting of multiple servers.

It gives us a possibility of deploying multiple applications as containers by using YAML files where we provide a specification about how those containers need to be created.

It also helps with networking between containers. Each container can get assigned easily a static IP address and a DNS name.
