# Introduction
Shell is a program which is used to interact with an operating system. There are two types of shell:
- Graphical – for example desktop, file explorer
- Command line – for example sh, bash, powershell

Shell takes an input from a user and returns an output.

On Linux the sh shell is installed in the /bin/sh and bahs in the /bin/bash.
