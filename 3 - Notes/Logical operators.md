# Introduction
Here are listed common logical operators:
- $\vee$ - Means 'or' (for example $x > 1 \vee x < -1$)
- $\wedge$ - Means 'and' (for example $x > 1 \wedge x > 5$)
- $\forall$ means 'for all', e.g. $\forall x \in A: x > 5$ means for every x which belongs to the set A, x > 5
- $\exists$ means 'exists', e.g. $\exists x \in A: x > 5$ means that there exists such a x which belongs to the set A, that x > 5
- $\implies$ means implication, e.g. $x > 5 \implies x > 4$ means that the fact that x > 5 implies the fact that x > 4
- $\iff$ means if and only if. If we write $A \iff B$ it means that A implies B ($A \implies B$) and B implies A ($B \implies A$)
