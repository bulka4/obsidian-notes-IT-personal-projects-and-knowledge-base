## C parameter for sklearn logistic regression

Inverse of regularization strength, higher values of C will cause model to have bigger coefficients values and be more fitted to training data, lower C causes model’s coefficients to be smaller and model is less fitted to the training data. Good values for C to test are powers of 10, so 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, etc.

## Solver argument for logistic regression

It’s algorithm to use for finding maximum of likelihood.
