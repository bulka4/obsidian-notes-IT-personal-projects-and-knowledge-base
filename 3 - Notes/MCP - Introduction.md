# Introduction

Official documentation about MCP: [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro).

MCP is a protocol which enables LLMs to use different tools.

There are two components of MCP:
- MCP server – App where we define different tools which can be used by LLMs.
- MCP client – App where LLM is using tools from a MCP server

In this document we will focus on FastMCP.

FastMCP is an official Python SDK for working with MCP: [gofastmcp.com](https://gofastmcp.com/getting-started/welcome). It makes it easy to create a MCP server and client in Python.
