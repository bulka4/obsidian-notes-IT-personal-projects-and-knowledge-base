# Introduction
A centralized model store where you manage the lifecycle of your ML models:
- Versioning: Keep track of every model version registered
- Stage transitions: Move models through stages like Staging, Production, Archived
- Annotations & comments: Add notes or tags on model versions
- Deployment integration: Some frameworks can deploy directly from the registry

It basically brings model governance and collaboration to your ML pipeline.
