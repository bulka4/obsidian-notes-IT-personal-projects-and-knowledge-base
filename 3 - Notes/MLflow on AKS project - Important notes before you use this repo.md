# Introduction
Here are important informations we need to know before you start working with this repo.
# Why to use Docker?
We are using here Docker to prepare environment to interact with AKS but it is not necessary to use it.

Instead of running a Docker container on our machine, we can prepare environment for interacting with AKS on our host machine itself.

If we have a Linux or MacOS, then we can take bash scripts from this Dockerfile and execute them on our machine.
# Sensitive data
Some files generated by Terraform will contain some sensitive data - credentials to a Service Principal used for authentication when interacting with AKS and ACR. Those files should be included in the .gitignore:
- Dockerfile
- values.yaml
