# Introduction
This repository contains Terraform code which:
- Creates AKS
- Generates a Dockerfile - Which can be used to run a container with prepared environment to interact with created AKS. From that container we can:
    - Deploy MLflow Tracking Server on AKS
    - Run MLflow project on AKS

For deploying MLflow Tracking Server and running MLflow project we will be using Helm charts from this repository, in the docker > helm_charts folder:
- mlflow_project - Running a project
- mlflow_setup - Deploying Tracking Server and preparing other resources needed to run the project

Both Helm charts will be copied to the container for interacting with AKS.

Further in this document we have the following main sections:
- Important notes before you use this repo - Read this first before start working with code from this repo
- Repository guide - How to use this code
- Prerequisites - What we need to do before we start using code from this repo
- MLflow setup Helm chart - Helm chart for deploying resources needed for deploying the MLflow Tracking Server and running MLflow project
- MLflow project - How do we prepare a MLflow project for training and evaluating model
- Docker container for interacting with AKS - More details about the Docker image created using the Dockerfile generated by Terraform
- Creating Azure resources with Terraform - What Azure resources we create using Terraform and how
- Problems, ideas for improvements and notes - Additional notes about the code useful for a future development
