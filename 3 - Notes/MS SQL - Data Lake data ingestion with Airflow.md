# Introduction
I prepared one PoC about how to orchestrate a Python script which is ingesting data incrementally from a MS SQL server into an Azure Data Lake using Airflow.

There is the PowerPoint presentation about that and videos in the ‘Airflow Data Lake data ingestion’ folder in the same folder as this document. It describes the on a high level what this PoC is about.
