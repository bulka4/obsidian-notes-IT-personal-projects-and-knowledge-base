# Introduction
When input for a machine learning model is a 1-D tensor, that is a vector, usually each number in that vector indicates value of some feature based on which we will be making predictions.
# Example
For example, 1-D input tensor can represent a set of features of a house, such as:
- Area
- Number of bathrooms
- Location (Address text converted into a number)
# 2-D and 3-D representation
1-D tensor of shape $(H)$ can be also represented as:
- 2-D tensor of shape $(H, 1)$ 
- 3-D tensor of shape $(H, 1, 1)$
