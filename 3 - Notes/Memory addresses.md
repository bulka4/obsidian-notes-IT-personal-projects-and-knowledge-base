# Introduction
Every byte in memory (RAM, VRAM) has assigned a unique address which is a number. 

Larger values, which consist of many bytes, uses multiple consecutive addresses. For example, if value uses 4 bytes, it might use addresses from 1000 to 1003.
# Reading data from memory
When reading multiple bytes at once, it is faster if those bytes have assigned consecutive addresses.
