# Introduction
Memory fragmentation is a situation when data elements are stored in different parts of memory ([[Memory addresses|link]]) (CPU RAM or GPU VRAM), not close to each other (they are scattered, non-contiguous). That causes, that accessing those elements is less efficient.

Also, it refers to a situation when free memory is scattered into small, non-contiguous chunks (they are not close to each other). Such a free memory can't be used efficiently for new data.

Memory reallocation is a process of changing a location in memory where data is saved. We can perform memory reallocation to bring related data elements close to each other to avoid memory fragmentation.
