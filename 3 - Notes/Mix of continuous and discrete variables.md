# Introduction
When input for a model is a mix of discrete and continuous variables ([[Types of variables used for creating ML models|link]]), then we can use discrete variables as an input for one neural network model, continuous as an input for another one, concatenate outputs from both models, and use them as an input for another model.

Or Decision trees can handle such a mix of different kinds of variables.
