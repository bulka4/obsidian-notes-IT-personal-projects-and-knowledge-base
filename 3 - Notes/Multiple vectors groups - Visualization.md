# Introduction
Let's assume, that we have assigned values to different vectors and we group those vectors, such that:
- Each group contains vectors with the same value assigned
- Different groups have different values assigned

Below sections visualize different scenarios of how those groups might look like.
# Vectors as points
Let's remind that vectors can be visualized as points, as described here - [[Vectors visualization|link]].
# Clearly separated groups
Clearly separated groups of vectors in 2-D can be visualized like this:

# Overlapping groups
Overlapping groups of vectors in 2-D can be visualized like this:
