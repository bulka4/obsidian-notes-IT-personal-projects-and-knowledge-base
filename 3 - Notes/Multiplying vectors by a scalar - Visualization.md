# Introduction
Since vectors can be visualized as arrows as described here - [[Vectors visualization|link]], multiplying a vector by a scalar can be seen as stretching / shrinking a vector, for example:
- Stretching a vector (red one) two times to create two times longer vector (green one, increasing its distance from the origin two times):
$$
2 \cdot (1, 1) = (2, 2)
$$
- Shrinking a vector (red one) two times to make it two times shorter (blue one):
$$
0.5 \cdot (1, 1) = (0.5, 0.5)
$$
