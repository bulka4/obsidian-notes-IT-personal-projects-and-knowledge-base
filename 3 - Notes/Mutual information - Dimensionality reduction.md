# Introduction
Mutual information ([[Mutual information|link]]) can be used for dimensionality reduction ([[Dimensionality reduction|link]]). For every feature $X_i$, mutual information tells us, how useful is that feature for predicting the target variable $Y$.

So we can reduce number of features by selecting only those, for which mutual information is the highest.
