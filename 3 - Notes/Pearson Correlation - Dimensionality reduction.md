# Introduction
Pearson Correlation ([[Pearson Correlation|link]]) can be used for a dimensionality reduction as described here -[[Dimensionality reduction|link]].

If we have a set of different random variables $X_i$ representing features ([[Dataset of observations of random variables X, Y - Variables per sample, feature and target variable|link]]), then in order to reduce their amount, we can choose those features $X_i$ which have the highest absolute value of a Pearson Correlation $|\text{Corr}(X_i, Y)|$ .
