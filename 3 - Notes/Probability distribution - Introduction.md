# Introduction
Probability distribution is a measure allowing us to calculate probabilities of events generated by random variables.

There are separate definitions for a joint and conditional probability.

Usually it is possible to represent a probability distribution measure using another measure, chosen by us, and probability distribution function.

Then we can use that new measure and probability distribution function for calculating probabilities.
