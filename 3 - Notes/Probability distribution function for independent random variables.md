# Introduction
If we have independent random variables $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ ([[Independency of random variables|link]]), then:
$$
\Large
p_{X_{1:n}}(x_{i:n}) = \prod_{i=1}^n p_{X_i}(x_i)
$$
where
- $\Large p_{X_{1:n}}$ - Joint probability distribution function ([[Probability distribution (density, mass) function|link]]) of $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ 
- $\Large p_{X_i}$ - Probability distribution function of $X_i$ 

This formula can be derived from the definition of independent random variables ([[Independency of random variables|link]]).
# Conditional probability
For a conditional probability we have the same relation:
$$
\Large
p_{Y_{1:n} \mid X}(y_{i:n}) = \prod_{i=1}^n p_{Y_i \mid X}(y_i)
$$
