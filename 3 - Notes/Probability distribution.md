# Introduction
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space ([[Probability space (events, probability measure)|link]]). 

A probability distribution of a random variable ([[Random variable|link]]) $X$ (can be a multivariate ([[Multivariate random variable|link]]) and discrete, continuous or mixed ([[Types of random variables|link]])):
$$
X: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}})
$$
is the pushforward measure ([[Measure|link]]) of the probability measure  under $X$, that is:
$$
P_X = P \circ X^{-1}
$$
It is used to calculate probabilities of events generated by the random variable ([[Event generated by a random variable|link]]) this way:
$$
P(X \in A) = P_X(A) = P(X^{-1}(A)) = P(\{\omega \in \Omega:\ X(\omega) \in A\})
$$
And using properties of the Lebesgue integral ([[Lebesgue integral|link]]) we have:
$$
P(\{\omega \in \Omega:\ X(\omega) \in A\}) = \int_\Omega \mathbb{1}\{X(\omega) \in A\} dP(\omega)
$$
where $\mathbb{1}$ is the indicator function.
# Formal definition
Let's assume that:
- $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ - Probability space
- $X: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}})$ - Random variable (can be a multivariate and discrete, continuous or mixed)

**Probability distribution** of $X$ is a pushforward measure of $P$ under $X$, that is:
$$
P_X = P \circ X^{-1}: \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}} \rightarrow [0, 1]
$$
So for every measurable set ([[Measurable set|link]]) $A \subseteq \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}}$:
$$
P(X \in A) = P_X(A) = P(X^{-1}(A)) = P(\{\omega \in \Omega:\ X(\omega) \in A\})
$$
And using properties of the Lebesgue integral ([[Lebesgue integral|link]]) we have:
$$
P(\{\omega \in \Omega:\ X(\omega) \in A\}) = \int_\Omega \mathbb{1}\{X(\omega) \in A\} dP(\omega)
$$
where $\mathbb{1}$ is the indicator function.
# Naming conventions
The probability distribution $P_X$ is also called:
- '**Joint probability distribution**' if $X = (X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ is a multivariate variable which consists of all the considered random variables
- '**Marginal probability distribution**' if $X = (X_1, \ldots, X_k)$ is only a subset of all the considered random variables ([[Marginal probability distribution|link]])
# Multivariate random variable
When $X$ is a multivariate random variable:
$$
X = (X_1, \ldots, X_n): (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{X}_1 \times \ldots \times \mathcal{X}_n,\ \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}_1} \otimes \ldots \otimes \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}_n})
$$
then we usually denote probability distribution as:
$$
\Large
P_{X_1, \ldots, X_n}
$$
or in short:
$$
\Large
P_{X_{1:n}}
$$
This measure is defined on the product measurable space ([[Product measurable space|link]]) $(\mathcal{X}_1 \times \ldots \times \mathcal{X}_n,\ \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}_1} \otimes \ldots \otimes \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}_n})$, but it doesn't have to be a product measure ([[Product measure|link]]).
## Multivariate random variable vs set of random variables
It is worth to highlight, as described here - [[Multivariate random variable vs set or random variables|link]], that considering a single multivariate random variable:
$$
X = (X_1, \ldots, X_n): (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{X}_1 \times \ldots \times \mathcal{X}_n,\ \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}_1} \otimes \ldots \otimes \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}_n})
$$
Is equivalent to considering a set of different random variables:
$$
\large
X_i: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{X}_i, \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}_i})
$$
Those concepts are equivalent and all the formulas and definitions work the same.

For example, probability distribution $P_X$ of a single, multivariate random variable $X = (X_1, \ldots, X_n)$ is equivalent to a joint probability distribution of its components $\Large P_{X_{1:n}}$.
# Probability distribution function
For a given probability distribution, there might exist a probability distribution function which allows to represent a probability distribution measure using another measure as described here - [[Probability distribution (density, mass) function]].
