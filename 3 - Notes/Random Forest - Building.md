# Scikit-learn
## n_estimators argument for random forest

It’s number of trees used. The bigger that value is the more accurate model is but also more complex so there is more calculations.

## max_samples argument for random forest

It determines what fraction of the original dataset is given to any individual tree.

## max_samples argument for random forest

It determines maximum number of features provided to each tree in a random forest.

## Random_state argument

It determines how we shuffle a dataset, if random_state = none then each time when we shuffle dataset this value is random and different, and we shuffle a dataset in a different way. When we set random_state equals to some integer then each time we shuffle dataset it will be shuffled in the same way. For different values of random_state a dataset is shuffled in a different way.
