# Introduction
Let $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ be a probability space ([[Probability space (events, probability measure)|link]]) and $(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}})$ be a measurable space ([[Measurable space|link]]).

A random variable is a measurable function ([[Measurable function|link]]), which we denote in different ways:
$$
\begin{align}
\text{1) } & X: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P) \rightarrow (\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}}) \\

\text{2) } & X: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}) \rightarrow (\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}}) \\

\text{3) } & X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathcal{X} \\
\end{align}
$$
We use sometimes notations 1) and 2) if we want to indicate what are the considered $\sigma$-algebras ($\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}}$) and probability measure ($P$).
# Measurability explanation
Function $X$ is measurable, so that means that it satisfies the condition:
$$
\forall B \in \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}},\ X^{-1}(B) = \{\omega \in \Omega \mid X(\omega) \in B\} \in \mathcal{F}
$$
The measurability condition makes sure that the pushforward measure, defined as
$$
P_X = P \circ X^{-1}
$$
is well defined.

The $P_X$ measure is a probability distribution ([[Probability distribution|link]]) of $X$ used to calculate probabilities:
$$
P(X \in A) = P_X(A) = P(X^{-1}(A)) = P(\{\omega \in \Omega:\ X(\omega) \in A\})
$$
So we need the set $X^{-1}(A)$ to be measurable ([[Measurable set|link]]), for every measurable set $A$, with respect to the probability measure $P$.
# Terminology
Common terminology related to random variables can be found here - [[Observations - realizations of random variables]].
# Space of all possible events
We can represent space of all possible events $\Omega$ as $\{\omega: X(\omega) \in \mathcal{X}\}$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is a set of all possible values of $X$.

So we can write:
$$
1 = P(\Omega) = P(\{\omega: X(\omega) \in \mathcal{X}\}) = P_X(\mathcal{X})
$$

So probability of all possible events is a probability of observing any possible value of $X$.
## Common example
We usually use:
- $\mathcal{X} = \mathbb{R}^d,\ d \in \mathbb{N}$ 
- $\mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}} = \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ (Borel $\sigma$-algebra ([[Borel sigma algebra|link]])) 

And then, we write:
$$
X: \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n
$$
# Discrete vs continuous random variables
Random variables can be either discrete, continuous or mixed what is described here - [[Types of random variables]].
# Event generated by a random variable
To learn more about how random variables are related to events and why do we need the measurability condition from the definition of a random variable, refer to the this document: [[Event generated by a random variable]].
# Multivariate random variable
A random variable can be also multivariate, i.e. multi-dimensional. More information about it can be found here - [[Multivariate random variable]].
