# Introduction
Content based system is a method for creating a recommendation system ([[Recommendation systems|link]]). In that system, we check items which given user liked so far and we find other, similar items.

Finding similar items is done based on their features. Each item has a set of features represented by numbers (a vector) and we can compare their similarity using for example cosine similarity.
