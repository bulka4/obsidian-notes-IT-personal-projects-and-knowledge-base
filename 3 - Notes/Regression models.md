# Introduction
Regression is a task of predicting value of a continuous variable ([[Types of variables used for creating ML models|link]]), for example a price of a house. That variable can have an infinite number of possible values.

For regression we can use such models as:
- AdaBoost
- Decision Tree
- KNN
- Linear Regression
- Neural Network
- Random Forest
- Transformer
