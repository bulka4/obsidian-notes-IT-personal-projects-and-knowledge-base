Residuals are a difference between our model's predictions and real values we were trying to predict. We calculate them using the formula:
$$
e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i
$$
where:
- $e_i$ - Residual for the i-th data sample
- $y_i$ - The real value for the i-th data sample
- $\hat{y}_i$ - Prediction of the real value for the i-th data sample# Variance & Bias
If the variance value is big that means that there are big differences in model’s accuracy for different datasets.

If bias values is small that indicates that a model is flexible and it can capture a true relationship between variables. You are able to train this model such that it has a good accuracy on a training dataset.
