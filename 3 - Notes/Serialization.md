# Introduction
Serialization is a process of converting an object in memory (for example a Python object, data structures, numpy arrays, ML models) into a byte format that can be:
- Stored (in a file, DB, or memory store), or
- Transmitted (over a network), and
- Later deserialized back into the original object.
