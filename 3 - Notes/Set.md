# Introduction
Set $A = \{a_1, ..., a_n\}$ is a collection of distinct objects, called elements or members. Those objects can be anything, numbers, functions, vectors or another sets.

Writing $a \in A$ means that element $a$ belongs to the set $A$, and $a \notin A$ means that it doesn't belong.
# Equality of sets
Sets $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if they contain exactly the same elements:
$$
A = B \iff (x \in A \iff x \in B,\ \forall x)
$$
# Subsets
A set $A$ is a subset of set $B$ if every element of $A$ also belongs to $B$:
$$
A \subseteq B \iff (x \in A \implies x \in B,\ \forall x)
$$
When we write $A \subseteq B$, that means that set $A$ can be equal to the set $B$. 

If $A$ is a subset of $B$ but it is can't be equal to $B$, then we write:
$$
A \subset B
$$
# Empty set
Empty set is marked as $\emptyset = \{\}$ and it is a set which doesn't contain any elements. 

Every set $A$ contains an empty set: 
$$
\emptyset \subset A,\ \text{for any set A}
$$
# Universal set
Universal set denoted as $U$ is a set of all elements under consideration in a given context.
# Common notations
- $\{x \mid x \in A\}$ or $\{x : x \in A\}$ - Set of elements $x$, such that $x$ belongs to set $A$. So we read "$\mid$" and ":" as "such that".
- $\emptyset$ - Empty set - it doesn't contain any elements
# Operations on sets
Common operations we can perform on sets are described here - [[Sets operations and annotations]].
