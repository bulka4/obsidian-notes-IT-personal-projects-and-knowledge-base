# Introduction
It represents a connection between our Spark application and the Spark cluster.

It initializes the Spark application and connects it to the cluster resource manager (like YARN or Kubernetes).

SparkContext manages the job scheduling, task dispatching to executors, and monitoring**.**

In Python (and other languages), you typically use SparkSession, which internally manages the SparkContext.
