# Introduction
For information about how to deploy Spark Thrift Server with an external Hive Metastore on Kubernetes refer to documents below about the 'Data and ML platform project'. 

In this project we deploy more solutions than just Thrift Server but its code and documentation can be used to deploy only Thrift Server:
- [[Data and ML platform project]]
- [[Data and ML platform project - Data transformation (prod, AKS)]]
- [[Data and ML platform project - Prod repository guide (AKS)]]
- [[Data and ML platform - Dev repository guide (kind)]]
