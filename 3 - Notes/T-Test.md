T-test allows us to check if two datasets are significantly different. We can use it to determine if a categorical variable with two possible categories has significant impact on another, continuous variable.

For example let’s assume that we want to check if variable called ‘mutant’, which indicates if a mouse is a mutant or a regular mouse, has impact on variable ‘size’ indicating a mouse’s size. We can use t-test to check if mices which are mutants are significantly different then regular mices in terms of size.
