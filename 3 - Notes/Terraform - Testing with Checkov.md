# Introduction
The checkov is a tool for checking if we are exposing confidential data in our code or if we are following the recommended best practices for our code, like do we have all the recommended settings.

It also allows us to define our own rules (policies) which should be followed when writing a code and it can automatically validate them.

Another similar tools:
- Terrascan
- Trivy
- Sentinel
- Snyk
- Mondoo
- Terratest
