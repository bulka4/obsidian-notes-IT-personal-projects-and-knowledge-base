# Introduction
In order to evaluate a model, we split our available dataset into two parts:
- Training dataset - Used for training a model
- Testing dataset - Used for evaluating a model
# Training dataset
Training dataset is a dataset ([[Dataset of observations of random variables X, Y - Variables per sample, feature and target variable|link]]) used to train a model. Model looks at a set of features $X = [x_1, \ldots, x_d]$ and corresponding target variable $Y$ and changes its parameters, such that its predicted value is as close as possible to the value of $Y$.
# Testing dataset
Testing dataset contains data samples which model didn't see during the training. It is used to test how well model performs on a new data, which it didn't see before.
