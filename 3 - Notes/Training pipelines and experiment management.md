# Introduction
Goals:
- Be able to reproduce models in the future
- Keep track of what experiments we conducted and how they performed- what model type, hyperparameters and data were used

Tasks:
- Create automated training pipelines (preparing data, training a model, testing it and saving)
- Manage dataset versions
- Scale training jobs
