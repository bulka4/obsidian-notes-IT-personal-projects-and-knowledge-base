# Introduction
As described here - [[Converting categorical variables into numeric ones|link]], as an input for ML models we can use only numeric variables, not categorical.

Usually, those input numeric variables are tensors ([[Tensor|link]]) with max 4 dimensions:
- 1-D tensor - A vector ([[Vector|link]])
- 2-D tensor - A matrix ([[Matrix|link]])
- 3-D tensor - Can be seen as a matrix with vectors as elements (or vector which elements are matrixes)
- 4-D tensor - Can be seen as a series of 3-D tensors

More information about those different types of an input with examples can be found in the documents below:
- [[Machine Learning models - 1-D input]]
	- [[Sparse vs Dense vectors]]
- [[Machine Learning models - 2-D input]]
- [[Machine Learning models - 3-D input]]
- [[Machine Learning models - 4-D input]]
