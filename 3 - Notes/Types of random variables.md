# Introduction
Let $X: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P) \rightarrow (\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}})$ be a random variable ([[Random variable|link]]) and $P_X$ be its probability distribution ([[Probability distribution|link]]).

In short, probability distribution $P_X$ is a measure which assigns a probability (mass) to events (sets) generated by a random variable ([[Event generated by a random variable|link]]):
$$
P_X(A) = P(X \in A) = P(\{\omega \in \Omega: X(\omega) \in A\})
$$
where $\Omega$ is a set of all possible events.
## Discrete random variable
Random variable $X$ is discrete if its probability distribution $P_X$ is concentrated on countable ([[Countable and uncountable set|link]]) events, i.e. countable amount of possible values of $X$.

Or we can also say that a probability mass is distributed on a countable amount of possible values of $X$.

That means that there is a countable set $\large \hat{\mathcal{X}} = \{x_i\}_{i \ge 0}$ of all possible values of $X$ and probability of observing a single value from that set is non-zero:
$$
P(X = x) > 0, \forall x \in \hat{\mathcal{X}}
$$
While for other values it is zero:
$$
P(X = x) = 0, \forall x \in \mathcal{X} \setminus \hat{\mathcal{X}}
$$

Also we can list all the possible events (all the possible values of $X$) which has assigned non-zero probability which sum up to 1, that is:
$$
\Large
\begin{align}
 & 1 = P(\Omega) = P(\{\omega \in \Omega: X(\omega) \in \mathcal{X}\}) = P(\{\omega \in \Omega: X(\omega) \in \hat{\mathcal{X}}\}) = \\
 
 & \quad = P(X \in \hat{\mathcal{X}}) = P(X = x_1 \vee X = x_2 \vee \ldots) = \sum_{x_i \in \hat{\mathcal{X}}} P(X = x_i)
\end{align}
$$
## Continuous random variable
Random variable $X$ is continuous if its probability distribution $P_X$ spreads probability smoothly across the space of all possible events (all the possible values of $X$).

That means that probability of observing a single value is zero:
$$
P(X = x) = 0,\ \forall x \in \mathcal{X}
$$
Only intervals, sets of multiple values has a positive probability.

If $P_X$ is absolutely continuous with respect to a continuous measure, then probability that $X$ belongs to some interval / set can be represented as the Lebesgue integral over that interval / set of a continuous function:
$$
P(X \in A) = \int_A p_X(x) d\mu(x)
$$
That function $p_X$ is called a probability distribution (density) function ([[Probability distribution (density, mass) function|link]]).

If we use the Lebesgue measure and $\mathbb{R}$ as $\mathcal{X}$, then that integral becomes:
$$
P(X \in [a, b]) = \int_a^b p_X(x) dx
$$
# Formal definition
Let's assume, that:
- $X: (\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P) \rightarrow (\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{B}_{\mathcal{X}})$ - Random variable 
- $P_X = P \circ X^{-1}$ - Probability distribution of$X$ (pushforward measure) 

If $P_X$ is absolutely continuous with respect to a discrete measure ([[Discrete measure|link]]), then $X$ is called discrete.

If $P_X$ is absolutely continuous with respect to a continuous measure ([[Continuous measure|link]]), then $X$ is called continuous.
# Mixed random variables
There can be also a mixed random variable which contains both discrete and continuous components.

So the part of the probability distribution is concentrated on countable points and other part is spread out over other region.

The distribution can be then written as:
$$
\large
P_X = \alpha P_{\text{discrete}} + (1 - \alpha) P_{\text{continuous}},\ \alpha \in (0, 1)
$$
