# Introduction
Origin is the zero point $(0, \ldots, 0)$.

A vector $x = (x_1, \ldots, x_d) \in \mathbb{R}^d$ can be seen as:
- A point in a $d$-dimensional space
- An arrow from the origin to that point (a direction)

For example, in a 2-D space, a vector [1, 2] can be seen as:
- A point with coordinates x = 1 and y = 2 
- Or an arrow pointing towards that point (top right-hand corner):
