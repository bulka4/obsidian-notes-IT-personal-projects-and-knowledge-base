# Introduction
We can create the sources.yml file which describes tables which are sources, that is they are not created by dbt. Just like in the schema.yml we are defining there data quality test, tables and columns descriptions.

We can have such a file created in the models folder and then it can be used by all the models, like it is shown on the screenshot in the ‘Schemas’ section above.
